# PT - Your Personal Transcriber
    ### Description:
    Let's say you want to record your thoughts using a voice recorder app, what sucks about those is that, when you want to check back in on what you recorded, you usually have to sit through the whole recording, just to get to the part you really want.
    This program seeks to offer a solution to this, by recording your voice and, subsequently, turning it into a text file using voice recognition.
